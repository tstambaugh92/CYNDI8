Chipper: A Chip8 Interpreter with some additional features.
Thomas Stambaugh

Updated 1/26/21:
This is a Chip8 Emulator with some additional features.

Support for adding color to these traditionally single color
games is included. Placing ".clr" files, simple hex files,
in the colors folders allows this. 

A clr file is simply a hex file written in 5 byte chunks.
The first two bytes of a chunk represents a chip 8 address.
If you know where the sprite is located in memory(see find
feature), use this. The next three bytes are RGB values.

The first two chunks in a clr file are for the background
color and the default draw color respectively.

When executing the program, the first argument should be
a path to the desired ROM.(GUI file selection a possiblity
in the future.) Additional arguments may be added after.

Arguments:
"debug" - Prints messages to the log.txt file, including a
full CPU/RAM dump at the end of the file. The log.txt file
contains every OP code executed like a stack trace.

"find" - Everytime the game draws a sprite, it prints the
address to the console. This helps make clr files for the
custom color feature.

License Notes: This project is mostly for my own educational
benefit. SDL2 uses the lgpl license, but any of my own code
is free to use as you see fit for non-commercial use. Credits
not required but shoutouts are cool.

Warranty: This software is as-is. No warranty, express or
implied, is offered. 

At the moment, binaries are not evan available, so really,
no warranty at all for code you compile yourself.
